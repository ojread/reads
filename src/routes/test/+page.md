# Just a test markdown file

That should get rendered as HTML.

But I don't really want to put MD directly as routes. I'd rather use it as a content database.

Maybe there is something to be said for scattering it all through the routes. I'll just have to scan for all md files, looking for a type in the frontmatter and set up a kind of DB in memory, or at least just a basic reference to each record. No that's rubbish and sveltekit doesn't allow normal filenames for routes any more.
